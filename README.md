# Android Application with Tensorflow Lite to detect Mushroom Genus's Images.

## About this Android Application
* This is an example project of integrating Tensorflow Lite into Android Application
* This project include an example of image classifying of Mushroom Genus's

## STEPS

1. Clone the repo
2. Install app dependencies
3. Run the app and classify

You can also use your trained Tensorflow Lite model to use in this application

## Using Your Own Model

1. Train and convert the model to Tensorflow Lite
2. Add the tensorflow lite model to assets folder
3. Initialize tensorflow lite interpreter
4. Run the application

## Step to increase the performance of the model

1. Train your model with regular settings
2. Evaluate the model
3. Tuning the parameter (Learning rate, Data Augmentation)
4. Train again until it gives better result
